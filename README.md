# ALM-ADD
This repository presents our work titled "Does Current Deepfake Audio Detection Model Effectively Detect ALM-based Deepfake Audio?," which was available on arxiv at "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10853".

The A03 VALL-E and A04 VALL-E X are same with the ALM subset (A1, A2) of Codecfake, which can be download at https://zenodo.org/records/11169781.

Pre-trained model can be found at "https://github.com/xieyuankun/Codecfake/tree/main/pretrained_model".

For the methods used to generate logits and calculate EER, please refer to [logits generation method](https://github.com/xieyuankun/Codecfake/blob/main/generate_score.py) and [EER calculation method](https://github.com/xieyuankun/Codecfake/blob/main/evaluate_score.py).
